    title: 'Creation',
    content: `To think!\nThat beauty can be found in all things, including the darkest pit of your gut.\nNot exclusionary to the lighter more beautiful parts of life.\nSadness cannot exist without its solar sibling, and therefore I will bask in the solar rays of joy.\nCreation can only be seen in the light and so I shall create in the light of day...\nAnd in the darkest of nights...\nI will create in spite. `
